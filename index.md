Section B08: Phi Nguyen
1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
The most interesting topic covered in this quarter was probably how SDG&E has a growing data science department and they are working with sectors of the company to integrate technology into the ground work and make it easier to find potential fire hazards.
2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
A potential investigation I'd like to pursue in Quarter 2 is using computer vision to identify potential vegetation fuel risks around power equipment like transformers and poles.
3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
A potential change I'd like to make is to start the project sooner. I know it was Phi's first time and I don't blame him but I would've been more comfortable if the project started sooner rather than later, like week 3 I think.
4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
I would like to do a web app that seems fun and was an application we were shown is used by the teams that observe the equipment.
